  <Card title="For Conversational AI" icon="chat">
    **Recommended**: Llama 2/3, Mistral, Anthropic models

    **Why**: Optimized for dialogue, human-like responses, following instructions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Domain-Specific Tasks" icon="brain">
    **Recommended**: Specialized models or larger general models

    **Why**: Better transfer learning, reduced fine-tuning requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Cost-Sensitive Applications" icon="dollar-sign">

  <Step title="Use Descriptive Names">
    **Good Examples**:
    - "customer-support-chatbot-v1"
    - "legal-document-qa-system"
    - "code-review-assistant"

    **Avoid**:
    - "test-project-1"
    - "my-model"
    - "untitled-project"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Naming Conventions">
    - Include use case, version, and date
    - Use consistent naming conventions across projects
    - Add detailed descriptions explaining project goals
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üìä Dataset Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity

<Note>
  **Golden Rule**: 100 high-quality examples often outperform 1,000 mediocre ones.
</Note>

#### High-Quality Dataset Characteristics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Diverse Examples">
    **Include variation in**:
    - Question complexity (simple ‚Üí advanced)
    - Answer length (concise ‚Üí detailed)
    - Topic coverage (broad ‚Üí specific)
    - User intent (informational, transactional, navigational)

    **Example for Customer Support**:
    ```jsonl
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I reset my password?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've been trying to reset my password for 2 hours and nothing works. I'm locked out and frustrated. Can someone please help me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistent Formatting">
    **Maintain consistency in**:
    - Response structure and tone
    - Technical terminology usage
    - Citation and reference formats
    - Code formatting (if applicable)

    **Template Example**:
    ```text
    Question: [Clear, specific question]
    Answer: [Brief summary] + [Detailed explanation] + [Example if needed]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accurate & Factual">
    **Quality checks**:
    - Verify all factual claims
    - Ensure code examples actually work
    - Cross-reference domain-specific information
    - Remove contradictory examples
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Dataset Size Guidelines

| **Use Case** | **Minimum Size** | **Recommended Size** | **Notes** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Simple Classification** | 50-100 examples | 200-500 examples | Clear categories, limited complexity |
| **QA Systems** | 100-300 examples | 500-1000 examples | Diverse question types needed |
| **Conversational AI** | 300-500 examples | 1000-2000 examples | Multiple conversation flows |
| **Code Generation** | 200-400 examples | 800-1500 examples | Various programming patterns |
| **Domain Expertise** | 500-1000 examples | 1500-3000 examples | Complex domain knowledge |

    **Result**: Faster convergence, higher risk of instability
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Epoch Configuration

```text
üìà Training Progress Guidelines:
