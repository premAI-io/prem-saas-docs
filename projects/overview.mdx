## What are Projects?

Projects in Prem Studio are your **orchestration hub** for end-to-end AI model development. Instead of managing datasets, fine-tuning jobs, and evaluations separately, Projects provide a **guided workflow** that connects all these components into a cohesive development pipeline.

Think of Projects as your **AI development roadmap** — they guide you from raw data to a production-ready, evaluated model through a structured, step-by-step process.

## The Complete Project Workflow

Project Workflow: Project Setup → Dataset Creation → Fine-tuning → Metrics -> Evaluation

Every project follows this proven workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project Setup">
    Define your project name and objective.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Dataset Creation">
    Choose your path:
    - **Upload existing JSONL** datasets if you already have training data
    - **Generate synthetic datasets** from PDFs, websites, videos, or other sources

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fine-tuning">
    Train your selected model on your dataset with automated parameter optimization.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Metrics">
    Define custom evaluation rules and metrics that align with your specific use case and quality standards.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluation">
    Test your fine-tuned model against your defined metrics to validate performance and reliability.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Complete">
    Deploy your validated model with confidence, knowing it meets your quality standards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iteration Loops">
    Projects are **not one-and-done** — they’re designed for iteration:

    - **Dataset Expansion** → Refine or add new samples when evaluation highlights weaknesses.
    - **More Fine-tuning Jobs** → Train new models with different parameters or approaches.
    - **New Metrics** → Add metrics to better evaluate new behaviors.
    - **Re-evaluation** → Apply the same or updated metrics to compare across models.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Use Projects?

### Guided Experience

Projects eliminate guesswork by providing a clear, sequential workflow. Perfect for users new to AI development or teams wanting standardized processes.

### Seamless Integration

All components (datasets, fine-tuning, evaluation) work together seamlessly. No need to manually connect outputs from one step to inputs of the next.
