## What are Projects?

Projects in Prem Studio are your **orchestration hub** for end-to-end AI model development. Instead of managing datasets, fine-tuning jobs, and evaluations separately, Projects provide a **guided workflow** that connects all these components into a cohesive development pipeline.

Think of Projects as your **AI development roadmap** — they guide you from raw data to a production-ready, evaluated model through a structured, step-by-step process.

## The Complete Project Workflow

<img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/projects/workflow-diagram.png" alt="Project Workflow: Project Setup → Dataset Creation → Fine-tuning → Evaluation → Complete" />

Every project follows this proven workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project Setup">
    Define your project name and objective.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Dataset Creation">
    Choose your path:
    - **Upload existing JSONL** datasets if you already have training data
    - **Generate synthetic datasets** from PDFs, websites, videos, or other sources

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fine-tuning">
    Train your selected model on your dataset with automated parameter optimization.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Metrics">
    Define custom evaluation rules and metrics that align with your specific use case and quality standards.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluation">
    Test your fine-tuned model against your defined metrics to validate performance and reliability.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Complete">
    Deploy your validated model with confidence, knowing it meets your quality standards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Use Projects?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Guided Experience">
    Projects eliminate guesswork by providing a clear, sequential workflow. Perfect for users new to AI development or teams wanting standardized processes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Seamless Integration">
    All components (datasets, fine-tuning, evaluation) work together seamlessly. No need to manually connect outputs from one step to inputs of the next.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Flexible Dataset Options">
    Projects accommodate both scenarios:
    - **Bring Your Own Data**: Upload pre-formatted JSONL datasets
    - **Start from Scratch**: Generate synthetic datasets from various input sources
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quality Assurance">
    Built-in evaluation ensures your models meet performance standards before deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>
