<Note>
    You can only evaluate a model if you have a snapshot of your dataset.
</Note>

## Create an New Evaluation
To create a new evaluation, you need to have a fine-tuned model. If you don't have a fine-tuned model, you can create one by following the steps in the [Fine-Tuning](/finetuning/overview) section.

You need to fill out the following fields:

- **Evaluation Prompt**: The prompt to use for the evaluation.

### Example of an Evaluation Prompt

> Convert medical reports into ICD-10 codes.
>
> You will be given a textual medical report. The model must return a list of ICD-10 codes.
>
> Evaluate:
>
> Are the codes valid and from the ICD-10 standard?
> Do the codes align with the diagnosis mentioned in the report?
> Are there unnecessary or incorrect codes predicted?

- [Dataset](/datasets/overview): The dataset to use for the evaluation.
- [Snapshot](/datasets/create-snapshot): The snapshot of the dataset to use for the evaluation.
-  Models: You can select multiple models to evaluate.

Once you have filled out the fields click the "Create Evaluation" button.

## Check Your Results

Once you have created an evaluation, you can check your results by clicking on the evaluation and each datapoint to get more details.

### Here are Some Results to Keep in Mind:
- **Average Score**: The average score of the evaluation for the model.
- **Model Name**: The name of the model the evaluation was run on.
- **System Prompt**: The system prompt used for the evaluation.
- **User Message**: The user message from the dataset.
- **Original Assistant Message**: The original assistant message from the dataset.
- **Predicted Assistant Message**: The predicted assistant message from the model.
- **Model Score**: The score of the model chosen for the evaluation.
- **Score Reason**: The reasoning behind the score.
