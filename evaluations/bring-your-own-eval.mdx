# Why Bring Your Own Evaluation?
You can bring your own evaluation to Prem. This is useful if you have a custom evaluation that you want to use for your model.

You may be coming from another platform like Modal and want to bring your own evaluation methods to Prem.

# How The Evaluation Process Works

The Prem Studio server sends your evaluation endpoint three key components:
- Each datapoint from your selected snapshot
- The model names being tested
- The corresponding responses

Your endpoint should return a numerical score and reasoning for each evaluation.

The evaluation results—including scores and any additional metadata—will be displayed in the final dashboard. This approach allows you to conduct comprehensive in-house evaluations using Prem's infrastructure and models while keeping your proprietary evaluation logic secure
