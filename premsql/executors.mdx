description: Connects to databases and executes generated SQL queries to fetch results.

An executor executes the generated SQL queries against
the database and fetches the results.
It is a crucial component in the Text-to-SQL pipeline, as
it ensures that the generated SQL queries are valid and
return the expected results.

PremSQL supports a native executor for SQLite databases and also supports [LangChain's SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/tools/sql_database/)
as an executor. You can also create custom executors for other database. Let's start by importing the required libraries:

```python
from premsql.executors import SQLiteExecutor

# Instantiate the executor
executor = SQLiteExecutor()

# Set a sample dataset path
db_path = "./data/db/california_schools.sqlite"
sql = 'SELECT movie_title FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC LIMIT 1'

# execute the SQL
result = executor.execute_sql(
    sql=sql,
    dsn_or_db_path=db_path
)

print(result)
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```python
{'result': [('Brief Encounter',)], 'error': None, 'execution_time': 0.03717160224914551}
```
</Accordion>

The `execute_sql` method returns a dictionary with the following keys

- `result`: The result of the SQL query execution.
- `error`: Any error that occurred during the execution.
- `execution_time`: The time taken to execute the SQL query.

You can also use other methods like:

- `match_sqls()` to match the generated SQL with the ground truth SQL.
- `iterated_execution()` to execute the SQL iteratively and comparing with the ground truth to see the execution time ratio.


Similarly lets use the LangChain's SQLDatabase as an executor:

```python
from premsql.executors import ExecutorUsingLangChain

executor = ExecutorUsingLangChain()
executor.execute_sql(
    sql=sql,
    dsn_or_db_path=db_path
)
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```python
{'result': "[('Brief Encounter',)]",
 'error': None,
 'execution_time': 0.028678178787231445
}
```
</Accordion>

## Creating Custom Executors

You can create custom executors by inheriting from the `BaseExecutor` class and implementing the `execute_sql` method. Here's an example of a custom executor for a PostgreSQL database:

```python
import pg8000
import time
from premsql.executors.base import BaseExecutor

class PostgreSQLExecutor(BaseExecutor):
    def execute_sql(self, sql: str, dsn_or_db_path: str) -> dict:
        # Connect to the database using pg8000
        conn = pg8000.connect(dsn=dsn_or_db_path)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            cursor.execute(sql)
            result = cursor.fetchall()
            error = None
        except Exception as e:
            result = None
            error = str(e)

        end_time = time.time()
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()

        result = {
            "result": result,
            "error": error,
            "execution_time": end_time - start_time,
        }
        return result
```

Awesome now that we understand what executors are and how they work,
let's understand how to evaluate the generated SQL queries using the `Text2SQLEvaluator` in the next section.
