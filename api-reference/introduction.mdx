<Card title="Prem Is Also OpenAI Compatible" icon="handshake" href="/get-started/sdks">

Instead of using the Prem API, you can use the OpenAI SDK to generate chat completions with **Prem** by just changing the `base URL` and adding your `API key`.

See our [Client SDKs guide](/get-started/sdks) to learn how to use [Prem AI](/index) with OpenAI's API/SDK.

</Card>

This is the **API Reference** for **Prem AI**.

Here you can find documentation for all of the endpoints that are available in the Prem API. You can use the sidebar to navigate to the different sections.

**Prem** provides a REST API that you can use to interact with the platform with any programming language that can make HTTP requests.

### Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You'll need to create an API key first - see our [API Key guide](/api-reference/api-key) for instructions.

Once you have your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

The authentication is automatically picked up from the OpenAPI specification file:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
