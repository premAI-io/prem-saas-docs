Instead of using the Prem API, you can use the OpenAI SDK to generate chat completions with **Prem** by just changing the `base URL` and adding your `API key`.

Use our [Quickstart Guide](/get-started/quick-start) to learn how to use [Prem AI](/index) with OpenAI's API/SDK.

This is the **API Reference** for **Prem AI**.

Here you can find documentation for all of the endpoints that are available in the Prem API. You can use the sidebar to navigate to the different sections.

**Prem** provides a REST API that you can use to interact with the platform with any programming language that can make HTTP requests.
