description: "Learn how to adapt a Nemotron dataset, fine-tune a model, and evaluate safety guardrails using Bring Your Own Evaluation (BYOE)."
---

This tutorial guides you through creating a custom safety guardrail model. We will adapt the Nemotron dataset, fine-tune a model on Prem Studio, and evaluate it using a custom evaluator.

## Prerequisites

- A Prem Studio account
- Basic familiarity with Python (for dataset adaptation scripts)

<Steps>

  <Step title="Adapt Nemotron Dataset">
    First, we need to convert the [Nemotron Safety Guard Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Dataset-v3) into a JSONL format compatible with Prem Studio.

    Check out our tutorial on GitHub for a script to perform this conversion:

    <Card title="Nemotron Dataset Adaptation" icon="github" href="https://github.com/premAI-io/prem-studio-tutorials/tree/main/tutorials/nemotron-safety-dataset-adaptation">
      View the tutorial on GitHub to convert Nemotron data to Prem-compatible JSONL.
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Dataset to Studio">
    Once you have your `JSONL` file ready, upload it to Prem Studio.

    Follow the internal guide on uploading datasets:

      Learn how to upload your JSONL dataset to Prem Studio.
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Autosplit Dataset">
    After uploading, split your dataset into training and validation sets using the Autosplit feature.

    <Card title="How to Autosplit" icon="scissors" href="/datasets/autosplit-dataset#how-to-autosplit-a-dataset">
      Follow the guide to automatically split your dataset.
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Snapshot">
    Create a snapshot of your split dataset.

    The snapshot creates an immutable version of your data which is required for both **fine-tuning** and **evaluation**. This ensures that your results are reproducible and consistent across different runs.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fine-Tuning and Experiments">
    Now that your data is ready, you can start the fine-tuning process.

    ### Create a Fine-Tuning Job

    Start by creating a fine-tuning job with your snapshot.

      Follow the guide to create your first fine-tuning job.

    ### Configure Experiments

    You can customize your training parameters using Experiments to get the best results.

    </Card>

    ### Monitor Results

    Once the training is complete, analyze the loss curves and metrics.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluation (BYOE)">
    Finally, evaluate your fine-tuned model using **Bring Your Own Evaluation (BYOE)**.

    You can implement your own evaluation logic using our BYOE framework. Check out the tutorial below to learn how to set it up:
