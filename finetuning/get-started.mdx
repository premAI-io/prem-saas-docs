<Note>
  You can only fine-tune a model if you have a snapshot of your dataset.

    <Step title="Click + Create Finetuning Job">
        Get started by clicking the "Create Finetuning Job" button on the top right of the screen.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Name, Choose a Dataset and a Model Type">
        - Add a name for the fine-tuning job.
        - Choose a dataset to fine-tune on.
        - Choose a model type.

        When it comes to **Model Type**, choose between a **reasoning** or **non-reasoning** model.

        **Reasoning**: Ideal for applications requiring complex logical reasoning, mathematical analysis, or structured decision-making.


        **Non-Reasoning**: Best for applications focused on information delivery, creative content generation, or conversational interactions.

        <Note>
        Once you create a fine-tuning job your model will be ready for experimentation. You can see the indicator on your fine-tuning job.
