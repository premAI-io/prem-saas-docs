# What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot is a saved version of your dataset at a specific point in time. It is useful to keep track of your dataset's progress and to revert to a previous state if needed.

# How to Create a Snapshot

<Note>
    Need at least **10 datapoints** in training to create a snapshot. You can either use autosplit or manually split your dataset.
