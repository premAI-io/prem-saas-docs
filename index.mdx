Prem is a powerful AI platform that gives you all the tools necessary to create custom AI models through [Autonomous Fine-Tuning](/finetuning/overview).

Prem can also be used to [evaluate](/evaluations/overview) your models with our built-in metrics and tools.

Just load your [dataset](/datasets/overview), choose a model, and in a few minutes, you can have a distilled, fine-tuned model ready to use in no time.

With seamless dataset handling, you can upload existing JSONL datasets or create datasets from scratch using unstructured sources like documents, videos, and websites. The platform also enables dataset enrichment with synthetic data generation and provides end-to-end project workflows that connect dataset creation to fine-tuning and evaluation.

We designed Prem to make AI integration seamless, efficient, and effective so that you can focus on developing your product and not all the AI complexity.

We're different from other evaluation platforms and instead we give you the full package from chat completions to fine-tuning and evaluations.

**This Is What You Can Do With Prem:**

- Access the best in class AI models without any vendor lock-in.
- Seamlessly handle datasets: upload JSONL files, generate from unstructured sources (documents, videos, websites), or enrich existing datasets with synthetic data.
- Create [Projects](/projects/get-started) that provide guided end-to-end workflows from dataset creation to model deployment.
- [Autonomously fine-tune](/finetuning/overview) models with your own datasets to customize for your use case.
- [Evaluate](/evaluations/overview) your models with our built-in metrics and tools.
- Test your models with our built-in [Playground](/playground/overview).
- [Self-host](/inference/self-host) your models to use them in your own codebase.
- Keep track of your models and their performance over time with [Stats](/stats/overview).
