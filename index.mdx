Prem Studio is an end-to-end AI platform for building custom models. Generate [synthetic datasets](/datasets/overview) from PDFs, videos, and websites. [Fine-tune](/finetuning/overview) models autonomously, including [continuous fine-tuning](/get-started/aft) that improves from production data. [Evaluate](/evaluations/overview) and benchmark both base and fine-tuned models. Deploy API-ready models in minutes.

Get started by creating your first [Project](/projects/get-started).

**This Is What You Can Do With Prem:**

- Access the best in class AI models without any vendor lock-in.
- Seamlessly handle datasets: upload JSONL files, generate from unstructured sources (documents, videos, websites), or enrich existing datasets with synthetic data.
- Create [Projects](/projects/get-started) that provide guided end-to-end workflows from dataset creation to model deployment.
- [Autonomously fine-tune](/finetuning/overview) models with your own datasets to customize for your use case.
- [Evaluate](/evaluations/overview) your models with our built-in metrics and tools.
- Test your models with our built-in [Playground](/playground/overview).
- [Self-host](/inference/self-host) your models to use them in your own codebase.
