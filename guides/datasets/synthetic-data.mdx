## 🧠 Why This Matters

Don’t have a ready-made QA dataset? You don’t need one anymore.

Whether you’re fine-tuning a model or building a knowledge assistant, having QA data is essential. But not everyone has the time or resources to create it from scratch.

This feature lets you:
- ✅ Convert any textual content into usable QA pairs.
- 🚀 Instantly scale your training data, even from a few documents.
- 🔄 Reuse your documentation, whitepapers, or reports to fuel model training.
- 🛠️ Prepare data for model fine-tuning — natively supported in Prem Studio.


## 📁 What You’ll Need

To get started, you only need:
- A set of text-based input files (e.g. .pdf, .txt, .docx, .html)
- A Prem Studio account
- Optionally: Custom instructions to guide the QA generation process

In this example, we’ll use 5 input files about crypto concepts and trends.


## ⚙️ Step-by-Step: Using QA Generation in Prem Studio

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Dataset from the Datasets Section">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/nav-to-sd.gif" alt="GIF of navigating to synthetic data" />
    From the left sidebar, click on **Datasets**, then **+ Create dataset** (top right), and select the option **Synthetic Data**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upload Your Input Files">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/upload-files.gif" alt="GIF of uploading input files" />
    Drag and drop your documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT, HTML). In our example, we use 5 crypto-related files.
    </Step>

    <Step title="(Optional) Add Custom Instructions">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/custom-instructions-sd.gif" alt="GIF of entering instructions" />
    Tailor the output with extra instructions, e.g.:
    ```
    Only create questions related to blockchain, DeFi, and crypto tokens. Avoid generic or repetitive questions. Keep answers short and factual.
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate Your Dataset">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/click-generate-sd.gif" alt="GIF of generating dataset" />
    Click **Generate Dataset** and let Prem Studio do the rest. In our example, we generate 100 QA pairs from 5 documents in under a minute.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Review Your Synthetic Dataset">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/review-dataset.gif" alt="GIF of reviewing and editing the datapoints" />
    Click **Generate Dataset** and let Prem Studio do the rest. In our example, we generate 100 QA pairs from 5 documents in under a minute.
    </Step>

</Steps>


Once the process is complete, you’ll be able to preview the generated dataset, edit any entries, and use it directly in Prem Studio’s fine-tuning and evaluation tools.
Example Outputs:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|---------|
| What is a blockchain? | A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions. |
| What is the main purpose of tokens in DeFi? | To facilitate decentralized financial operations. |
| How do smart contracts work? | They execute predefined actions automatically based on conditions. |


## 📦 What’s Next?

You can now:
- Preview and edit the generated data
- Fine-tune a model on it (see our [fine-tuning guide](../../finetuning/get-started))
- Evaluate the models on it (see our [evaluation guide](../../evaluations/get-started))


## 💡 Pro Tips
- Upload diverse content to get a wide range of QA pairs.
- Use domain-specific instructions to control the output style.
- Start small (5–10 files) to experiment, then scale up.
