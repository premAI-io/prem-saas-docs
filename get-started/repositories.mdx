With **Repositories** you can just upload the documents and we take care of the rest. This guide will show you how to create **RAG-based** assistants that are able to interact with your documents.

**RAG** is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems and generative models to enable assistants to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the content of your documents.



## Before you get started

- Create a collection of documents that you'd like your LLM to interact with.

- Get a basic understanding of **Prem's** APIs and SDKs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create A Repository and Upload Your Documents">
  <Tip>
    The max file size is: 10MB
  </Tip>
    - Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Repositories** page. Click **_New Repository_** to create a new place to store your documents.

  alt="Overview"
/>
    - Prepare your documents in a format supported by **Prem**, such as **PDF**, **TXT**, or **DOCX**. Ensure that the documents are clean, well-structured, and free of any formatting issues.

    - Upload your documents to a repository using **Prem's** interface, [API](/api-reference/introduction) or using [PremSDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories). You can either upload documents individually or in batches. Make sure to provide meaningful names or identifiers for your documents.

    - Once the documents are uploaded, **Prem** will automatically index them to enable fast and efficient retrieval. 
  <Warning>
  The indexing process may take some time depending on the size and number of documents.  
  </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Model and Configure Retrieval Settings">
  Once you've uploaded your documents, you need to configure the retrieval settings. Head over to the [Lab](/get-started/lab) and choose a suitable model to test with your documents.
  
   You can find the following retrieval settings in the **Lab** or in the **Launchpad**:

  - **Limit:** Sets the maximum number of top-matching documents to retrieve based on similarity.
  
  - **Similarity:** Measures how closely a query matches document embeddings. Higher values indicate greater similarity, ranging from 0 to 1.
  
  </Step>

  <Step title ="Fine-tune the model with the Gym">

  <Warning>
    You **MUST** add a project description, otherwise you will not be able to start the training.
  </Warning>

  - Fine-tune your selected model in the [Gym](/get-started/gym) on your specific domain or task. This involves training the model on a subset of your documents and optimizing its parameters for better performance and coherence.
  - Integrate the fine-tuned model into your pipeline. When a user sends a query, the model will retrieve relevant documents from the repository and then pass them to the generative model to generate a contextually appropriate response.

  </Step>
  <Step title = "Testing and Evaluation">
Before deploying your configured model, it's crucial to thoroughly test and evaluate its performance in the **Lab**.

 - **Test Queries:** Prepare a set of test queries that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Send these queries to your assistant and evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated responses.

 - **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the evaluation results, iteratively refine your assistant by adjusting the retrieval settings, fine-tuning the generative model, or improving the document collection.
  
  <Note>You can see which documents were used as a verified source at the bottom of the model's response.</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title = "Deployment and Integration">
  Once you're satisfied with the performance of your models, you can deploy them with the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) and integrate your application with the Prem [SDKs](/get-started/sdk) or [API](/api-reference/introduction).
