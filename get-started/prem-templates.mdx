Writing Prompt Templates can be super messy. Prompt templates are long, hard to manage, and must be continuously tweaked to improve and keep the same throughout the application. 

With **Prem**, writing and managing prompts can be super easy. The **_Templates_** tab inside the [launchpad](/get-started/launchpad.mdx) helps you write as many prompts you need and use it inside the SDK to make your application running using those prompts. 

✌️ This guide shows you how to create a prompt template and use it using Prem SDK.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

<Step title="Go the Templates section of Launchpad">
    Inside the Templates section, hit the ➕ button to create a new prompt template.

</Step>


<Step title="Design your prompt template">
    Designing a new template is easy. Add a name to the prompt template and provide the contents of the template. A prompt template contains several variables that are passed dynamically during runtime. You can enter your variable name inside `${}`. Here is an example: 

    <CodeGroup>
    ```txt Text 
    You will be given a document, and you need to extract essential information 
    from the document and return it as a JSON. The JSON should have the following keys:

    1. name: should extract the name of a person
    2. place: should extract the name of a place or which sounds like a place
    3. date-time: should extract some date-time like text or which sound 
    like someday in a week or time. 

    Here is an example of how it should look like:

    Input document: "Alice told me a big fish is in our nearby pond. 
    We should go catch some fish with Alice and Ron this Sunday." 

    Output: 

    {
        "name" : ["Alice", "Ron"]
        "place":  ["nearby pond"]
        "date-time": ["Sunday"]
    }
    If you do not find any entity for some key, leave it a blank list. 
    Here is your document ${doc}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    In the application it should look like this: 
    <img src="/images/prompt-template/new-template.png" alt="Prem" />
    Hit the ➕ create button and your prompt template is created. 
</Step>

<Step title="Using the prompt template with Prem SDK">
Once we create a prompt template, we can see all our list of prompt templates.
<img src="/images/prompt-template/list-templates.png" alt="Prem" />

Now, you need to copy the template ID to use it. The template ID appears just below the name of the prompt template. Here, in case you missed it. 
<img src="/images/prompt-template/template-id.png" alt="Prem" />

Once copied we can use it in our SDK. 

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os 
from premai import Prem 

client = Prem(
    api_key=os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY")
)

# Change the project and template ID when using from your account. 
project_id = 1234 
template_id = "12069ce8-xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx"

msg = """
I am playing in a garden on a fine sunday
evening. I then went to my friend Tara's place
and then went for movies in the city center mall. 
"""

# Provide the template variables here:
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "template_id": template_id,
        "params": {
            "doc": msg
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    messages=messages,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Prem from '@premai/prem-sdk';

const client = new Prem({
    apiKey: "PREMAI_API_KEY"
})

const project_id = 4071;
const template_id = "78069ce8-ba83-4058-af31-fadaf316afeb"

const msg = `I am playing in a garden on a fine sunday
evening. I then went to my friend Tara's place
and then went for movies in the city center mall.`;

const messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "template_id": template_id,
        "params": {
            "doc": msg
        }
    }
]

const responseSync = await client.chat.completions.create({
    project_id,
    messages
})

console.log(responseSync.choices[0].message["content"])
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

That's it. Thats how easy it is to create and manage prompt templates in Prem.
