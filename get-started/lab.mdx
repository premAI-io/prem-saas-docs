## Playground

In the **Playground** section, you can experiment with various language models simultaneously and test them with any text you desire. Adjust **settings** such as creativity level (temperature) and output length (max tokens). You can also customize the starting point of the AI with a system prompt.

This allows you to observe how different AI models behave under different conditions. Feel free to **share** your experiments with colleagues or online communities.

Don't worry about losing your tests; all activities in the Lab are saved. You can revisit them to analyze what worked well and what didnâ€™t.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Select Models:** Choose from a variety of models, both open-source and closed-source, from multiple providers.
2. **Adjust Settings:** Experiment with temperature, max tokens, and system prompts to tailor the AI's behavior.
3. **Test Texts:** Enter the text you want the AI to continue or generate new content from.
4. **View Results:** Analyze the output generated by the AI models.
5. **Share:** Share them with others for feedback or further analysis.

## Chat

In the **Chat** section, you can interact with a language model in a conversational manner. Unlike the Playground, where you can experiment with multiple models simultaneously, here you can focus on testing out one model in a chat-like manner.

Similar to the Playground, you can **adjust settings** such as max tokens, temperature, and system prompts to customize the AI's responses. Additionally, you can **share** the chat sessions with others for collaboration or feedback.


## Status Page

We continuously monitor the performance and availability of all model providers. For detailed information on inference metrics and uptime, please refer to our [status page](https://models.premai.io/).
