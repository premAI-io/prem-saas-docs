Each project represents a single use case in order to enhance your product and integrate generative AI with it.
For example, if you're running an online store and using Prem, you could start a project called “Customer Support” to answer questions from your customers.

You can also make new projects, change them, or delete them if you need to. Think of each project as a test lab for trying out AI in ways that help your business.
