Prem Studio is a powerful feature that allows developers to create custom AI models without requiring machine learning expertise or human intervention.

Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, which require extensive experience and manual oversight, our autonomous fine-tuning agent only requires a well-curated dataset and a few granular parameters.

The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the Prem Studio agents are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so any type of developer can use it and focus on building the AI-enhanced applications they want to build.

Under the hood, Prem has sophisticated data augmentation and distributed training architectures that maximize your custom model's performance.

Save time, money and resources by letting Prem handle the heavy lifting.

This is one of our most detailed guides. So buckle up and get ready to fine-tune your models like a pro.

# Best Practices

<Warning>
  Click [here](https://docs.premai.io/get-started/autonomous-fine-tuning#getting-started%3A-step-by-step-guide) to skip to the step by step guide
</Warning>

### **Data Preparation: Start Small, Iterate Frequently**.

- Begin with a small well-curated examples for your specific use case. Even a small dataset can serve as a strong foundation when combined with the system's autonomous data augmentation.

### **Use the Prem Playground for Rapid Feedback**

- **Leverage the interactive comparison feature** in the Prem Playground to quickly gauge which model variant is performing well on your task.
- **Perform red-teaming tests** by providing diverse, challenging prompts. This not only uncovers vulnerabilities but also creates high-value data for subsequent fine-tuning stages.

### **Emphasize Quality in Data Collection**

- **Automated data harvesting** from production systems is powerful, but ensure you incorporate clear filtering and quality checks. Use domain-specific rules and engagement metrics to keep your training data relevant and noise-free.
- **Multi-dimensional annotations** (accuracy, relevance, style, etc.) can provide richer signals for model training, resulting in more robust outcomes.

### **Make the Most of Autonomous Data Augmentation**

- **Rely on the platform's multi-agent orchestration** to expand your dataset systematically without compromising on semantic consistency.
- **Configure domain constraints** carefully to avoid generating irrelevant or contradictory samples. For instance, if you're focusing on code generation, ensure that your sandboxed environment and validation criteria are well-defined before augmentation begins.

### **Choose the Right Model Family & Resources**

- **Select a model family** that aligns with your task domain (NL2NL, NL2C, or specialized models like Text to SQL). Each family has different baseline capabilities and constraints.

### **Continuously Evaluate & Prune**

- **Run parallel trainings** on different model candidates and let the system's leaderboard identify top performers. This multi-model strategy helps surface unexpected winners (smaller models may outperform bigger ones for certain tasks).
- **Prune underperforming models** early to save computational resources. Focus on refining promising candidates with additional synthetic data or domain-specific fine-tuning.

### **Close the Loop with Active Learning (Coming Soon ⚠️)**

- **Continually gather new examples** from both user feedback and system logs. The more "real-world" data you incorporate, the more resilient your models become.
- **Use feedback modification tools** in the Prem Platform to annotate or correct model responses. These corrected examples directly fuel the next iteration of fine-tuning.

# Getting Started: Step by Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your data (JSON or JSONL Only)">
    ******In order to fine-tune your model, you are required to submit a JSON or JSONL dataset in the following format:******

    ```json example.json
    [
      {
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "..."
          },
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "..."
          },
          {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    or in **JSONL** format (one **JSON** object per line):

    ```jsonl example.jsonl
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
    {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your fine-tuning job">
    ![Image of the autonomous fine-tuning job configuration page](https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/gym-guide/configureFinetuneImage.png)

    When configuring your fine-tuning job, you are required to provide the following:

    - **Fine-tuning Job Name**
    - **Base Model**: Select the base model you'd like to use.
    - **Training Depth**: Use the slider to select the training depth between quick and deep training.

      **Key Differences**:
      - **Complexity**: Deep models (deep training depth) learn more complex and abstract features, whereas quick models might focus on simpler, more direct representations.
      - **Performance vs. Resources**: Deep models often provide better performance on complex tasks but require more computational resources and time to train. Quick models are faster to train and use less resources but may not perform as well on challenging problems.
      - **Training Time**: Models with deep training depth generally take longer to train due to the increased number of layers, which can complicate the learning process.
    - **A Dataset**: Drag and drop your dataset into the **Dataset** section. Make sure your dataset is in the correct format as shown [above](#prepare-your-data-json-or-jsonl-only).
